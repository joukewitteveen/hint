Hint is a hyperinterval finder.

It takes a numerical database, samples it and using compression techniques determines an interesting hyperinterval (multi-dimensional interval).

The data is fitted to the following interval form:
  [-A-)[-B-](-A-]
where a codelength based on a uniform density on A and B is calculated.

The choice of the splits as model parameters is taken with a uniform prior, which means its cost can be discarded without loss of generality.
This is untrue for comparison to the single uniform density coding [-A-].
Think of the middle interval [-B-] as a luckiness region.
